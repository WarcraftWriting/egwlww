# Earning Gold While Leveling in World of Warcraft

This project aims to be a comprehensive guide to earning gold while leveling a
character in World of Warcraft. This repository includes the guide itself,
along with the data from an experiment, called Project Loot, putting the
recommendations of the guide to the test, and fully documenting the process.

## Project Loot

For project loot, I will create a new character on a realm on which I have no
other characters. I will level that character to max level, tracking _all_
gold, and items looted along the way. I will follow the recommendations of the
guide.
