# Earning gold in world of warcraft while leveling
{:.no_toc}

This guide is for World of Warcraft (WoW) players looking to make gold while
leveling a character. It provides hints and tips for making money---without
having any fully-leveled professions. It assumes the reader knows little to
nothing about WoW, or the WoW auction house. Some of the knowledge contained
within is simply common sense, and most of it can be found in other
sources. It is hoped that by collecting this information in one place it will
provide the reader with convenience and insight not gained from gleaning
multiple other sources.

## The basics

### What can I sell on the auction house?

Just about anything. Nearly anything can be sold on the auction house. If you
don't believe me, check out <cite source>, <cite source>, or <cite
source>. But this isn't to say that you _should_ try to sell everything you
collect during your travels on the auction house. Some items just aren't worth
the time, effort, or expense of listing on the auction house.


### What _should_ I sell on the auction house?

To answer this question, we should first establish some vocabulary. If you've
read much at all about equipment in WoW, you've run across the terms "trash",
"white", "green", and "blue". In case you haven't figured it out already,
here's a table summarizing each of these terms:

<table>
  <summary>Equipment levels in World of Warcraft</summary>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Color</th>
      <th>Aliases</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Examples</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Grey</td>
      <td>Poor, junk, trash, vendor trash</td>
      <td>

        These items have little to no in-game value. They are not used in
        quests, and except at the lowest levels, will have no value to your
        character in game. They can be safely sold TODO: foot note to adds for
        selling junk.

      </td>
      <td>TODO: examples</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>White</td>
      <td>Common</td>
      <td>

        These items have some small value. They are often trade goods, used to
        level professions. Some are worth selling on the auction house. TODO:
        foot note to a section that talks about "vendor-threshold".

      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Green</td>
      <td>Uncommon</td>
      <td>

        This class of item represents most gear encountered while leveling in
        WoW. Some recipes will also be green. Quest rewards, except at the
        lowest levels, are mostly greens.

      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Blue</td>
      <td>Rare</td>
      <td>

        These items are—as their name implies—rare. They typically require
        extra effort to obtain. Examples include bosses in 5-man dungeons, or
        the ends of long quest chains. As a result, they tend to be better, in
        that they provide bigger stat bonuses than white or green gear of
        equivalent gear level.

        TODO: is gear level the most accurate term?
        TODO: define 5-man dungeon, provide example?
        TODO: define quest chain, provide example?

      <td>Epic</td>

      <td>Legendary</td>
      <td>
