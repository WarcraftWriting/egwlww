# Earning gold in world of warcraft while leveling
{:.no_toc}

This guide is for World of Warcraft (WoW) players looking to make gold while
leveling a character. It provides hints and tips for making money---without
having any fully-leveled professions. It assumes the reader knows little to
nothing about WoW, or the WoW auction house. Some of the knowledge contained
within is simply common sense, and most of it can be found in other
sources. It is hoped that by collecting this information in one place it will
provide the reader with convenience and insight not gained from gleaning
multiple other sources.

## Why should i care about making gold while leveling?

In short, [artisan riding](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=34091) and
[master riding](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=90265). Each of these skills
require 5,000 gold to train[^reduceable-by-faction-reputation]. While
technically luxury items, remember the old goblin adage, "Time is money
friend!". Being able to fly faster means more quests in less time, more gold
in less time, and more fun in less time.

## Goals

With the guidance of this guide, you should be able to earn enough gold to
purchase the basics for your character, namely:

* Adequate bags for storing needed gear and loot.
* All riding skills, as they become available by level.

Using the tips and techniques of this guide will not make you rich, but it
should allow you to level your character with enough gold to pay for the
things they need, when they need them. Your character will probably have
enough gold left over for a few fun items here and there too.

**My character is already level _X_, is it too late to start?** While you
might not be able to reach all of the goals cited above, it's never too late
to start earning gold. Start by making sure your [professions](#professions)
are in order, then continue reading the other sections of this guide.

<div class="col-md-8">
There are two broad classifications of professions in WoW, primary and
secondary. In terms of making gold, we're only interested in primary
professions. While secondary professions can make gold, they're orthogonal to
the act of leveling, and so aren't within the scope of this guide.

TODO: I'm not happy with the explanation of why we're only focusing on primary professions above, is it even true?

Among the primary professions, there are two more divisions, gathering and
crafting. While leveling, having gathering professions is strongly
recommended. The extra, nearly passive, incoming gained through gathering
professions is not to be discounted.

#### Leveling your professions

Leveling gathering professions while questing is easy, simply stop and gather
each herb, mine each deposit, or skin each skinnable corpse you encounter
while questing. As your character's skills progress, they can visit a skill
trainer to train your skills[^skinning-training]. Doing so allows your
character to practice their professions on higher-level herbs, ore deposits,
skinnable corpses, etc.

**What does it mean for a profession to "fall behind"?** A profession has
fallen behind when you can no longer practice it in zones of an appropriate
level for your character level[^zones-by-level]. For example, Alice, a level
50 night elf hunter, is currently questing in Burning Steppes. Unfortunately,
Alice hasn't been keeping up with her mining profession, and so her skill
level is 135. The most common mining deposits in Burning Steppes are mithril,
which require a mining skill of 150, so Alice is said to have "fallen behind"
because she effectively can't practice mining in the zones in which she
quests.

**What to do if your professions fall behind** In the event that your
gathering profession "falls behind", it is usually worth the effort to spend
some time playing catch-up with that profession. A quick WWW search will
easily yield tips on where to look for herbs, ore, or skinnable animals of an
appropriate skill level for your current skill.

### What can I sell on the auction house?

Just about anything. Nearly anything can be sold on the auction house. If you
don't believe me, check out &lt;cite source&gt;, &lt;cite source&gt;, or &lt;cite
source&gt;. But this isn't to say that you _should_ try to sell everything you
collect during your travels on the auction house. Some items just aren't worth
the time, effort, or expense of listing on the auction house.

### What _should_ I sell on the auction house?

To answer this question, we should first establish some vocabulary. If you've
read much at all about equipment in WoW, you've run across the terms "trash",
"white", "green", and "blue". In case you haven't figured it out already,
here's a table summarizing each of these terms:

<div class="table-responsive">
<table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
  <summary>Equipment levels in World of Warcraft</summary>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Color</th>
      <th>Aliases</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Examples</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Grey</td>
      <td>Poor, junk, trash, vendor trash</td>
      <td>

        These items have little to no in-game value. They are not used in
        quests, and except at the lowest levels, will have no value to your
        character in game. They can be safely sold TODO: foot note to adds for
        selling junk.

      </td>
      <td>TODO: examples</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>White</td>
      <td>Common</td>
      <td>

        These items have some small value. They are often trade goods, used to
        level professions. Some are worth selling on the auction house. TODO:
        foot note to a section that talks about "vendor-threshold".

      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Green</td>
      <td>Uncommon</td>
      <td>

        This class of item represents most gear encountered while leveling in
        WoW. Some recipes will also be green. Quest rewards, except at the
        lowest levels, are mostly greens.

      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Blue</td>
      <td>Rare</td>
      <td>

        These items are&mdash;as their name implies&mdash;rare. They typically
        require extra effort to obtain. Examples include bosses in 5-man
        dungeons, or the ends of long quest chains. As a result, they tend to
        be better, in that they provide bigger stat bonuses than white or
        green gear of equivalent gear level.

        TODO: is gear level the most accurate term?
        TODO: define 5-man dungeon, provide example?
        TODO: define quest chain, provide example?

      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Purple</td>
      <td>Epic</td>
      <td>

        TODO: write me
        TODO: write about how purples didn't exist before TBC? (Is that true? Ask Chris?)

      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
