# Project loot

Project Loot is aimed at validating the principles described in
"[Earning Gold While Leveling in World of Warcraft](earning-gold-while-leveling-in-world-of-warcraft.html)". A
(to be named) character is created---and following the guide---leveled to max
level. The character will receive no outside help from other characters on the
same account. The looting of _all_ gold and items will be tracked and
reported. Progress towards the goals of the guide will be reported.
